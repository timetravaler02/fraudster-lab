# Fraud Lab Toolkit

## Overview
This toolkit includes scripts and resources to simulate common fraudster tactics like SSL pinning bypass, rooted device exploitation, API fuzzing, and bot automation.

## Folder Structure
- rooted_device_setup: Scripts for rooting and Magisk installation
- ssl_bypass: Frida scripts to bypass SSL pinning
- apk_reverse: Tools & APK files for reverse engineering
- api_exploit: API fuzzing and exploitation scripts
- frida_hooks: Runtime hooks to manipulate app behavior
- modded_apk: Rebuilt and signed APKs
- bot_automation: Automated scripts to flood API
- monetization: Templates for selling virtual assets

## Usage

### Rooted Device Setup
Run `install_magisk.sh` on a rooted device or emulator.

### SSL Bypass
Run `run_burp.sh` to intercept HTTPS traffic via Burp Suite.

### API Exploit
Edit `exploit.py` with proper headers and endpoints. Run it to fuzz API endpoints.

### Frida Hooks
Use `hook_wallet.js` with Frida to modify in-app wallet behavior.
